## Response API
Responses
OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search, computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data using function calling.

Related guides:

Quickstart
Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
Structured Outputs
Function calling
Conversation state
Extend the models with tools
Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
background
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.

include
array or null

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

code_interpreter_call.outputs: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code interpreter tool call items.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
message.output_text.logprobs: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
reasoning.encrypted_content: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the store parameter is set to false, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).
input
string or array

Optional
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Show possible types
instructions
string or null

Optional
A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tool_calls
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Optional
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

prompt
object or null

Optional
Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.


Show properties
prompt_cache_key
string

Optional
Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the user field. Learn more.

reasoning
object or null

Optional
o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
safety_identifier
string

Optional
A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. Learn more.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. Contact sales to learn more about Priority processing.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming responses. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Show possible types
tools
array

Optional
An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about function calling. You can also use custom tools to call your own code.

Show possible types
top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

Optional
Defaults to disabled
The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
user
Deprecated
string

Optional
This field is being replaced by safety_identifier and prompt_cache_key. Use prompt_cache_key instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. Learn more.

verbosity
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values will result in more concise responses, while higher values will result in more verbose responses. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high.

Returns
Returns a Response object.

Get a model response
get
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/{response_id}
Retrieves a model response with the given ID.

Path parameters
response_id
string

Required
The ID of the response to retrieve.

Query parameters
include
array

Optional
Additional fields to include in the response. See the include parameter for Response creation above for more information.

include_obfuscation
boolean

Optional
When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds random characters to an obfuscation field on streaming delta events to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set include_obfuscation to false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between your application and the OpenAI API.

starting_after
integer

Optional
The sequence number of the event after which to start streaming.

stream
boolean

Optional
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

Returns
The Response object matching the specified ID.

The response object
background
boolean or null

Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.

created_at
number

Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when this Response was created.

error
object or null

An error object returned when the model fails to generate a Response.


Show properties
id
string

Unique identifier for this Response.

incomplete_details
object or null

Details about why the response is incomplete.


Show properties
instructions
string or array

A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.


Show possible types
max_output_tokens
integer or null

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tool_calls
integer or null

The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

metadata
map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

object
string

The object type of this resource - always set to response.

output
array

An array of content items generated by the model.

The length and order of items in the output array is dependent on the model's response.
Rather than accessing the first item in the output array and assuming it's an assistant message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the output_text property where supported in SDKs.

Show possible types
output_text
string or null

SDK Only
SDK-only convenience property that contains the aggregated text output from all output_text items in the output array, if any are present. Supported in the Python and JavaScript SDKs.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

prompt
object or null

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.


Show properties
prompt_cache_key
string

Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the user field. Learn more.

reasoning
object or null

o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
safety_identifier
string

A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. Learn more.

service_tier
string or null

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. Contact sales to learn more about Priority processing.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

status
string

The status of the response generation. One of completed, failed, in_progress, cancelled, queued, or incomplete.

temperature
number or null

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Show possible types
tools
array

An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about function calling. You can also use custom tools to call your own code.

Show possible types
top_logprobs
integer or null

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

top_p
number or null

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
usage
object

Represents token usage details including input tokens, output tokens, a breakdown of output tokens, and the total tokens used.


Show properties
user
Deprecated
string

This field is being replaced by safety_identifier and prompt_cache_key. Use prompt_cache_key instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. Learn more.

verbosity
string or null

Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values will result in more concise responses, while higher values will result in more verbose responses. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high.
